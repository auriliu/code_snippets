yes. select: false in schema only affects queries that don't override selection.

your code uses .select('-password'), which manually excludes the field.
if you had just used User.find(), the password would still show unless select: false is set in schema.

so:

    .select('-password') → explicitly excludes

    select: false → excludes by default in queries like User.findOne() or User.find() without select

both together give strong control.
